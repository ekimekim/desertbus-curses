Requires python 2.6 or 2.7

Run with ./main.py

Controls are:
UP: Accelerate
DOWN: Brake
LEFT: Steer left
RIGHT: Steer right

You can fiddle with various settings at the top of main.py.

This version should work, though it lacks features like giving the driver's name.
If you have any ideas or suggestions, tell me!
